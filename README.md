Ember TODO
==========

[Ember TODO][todo] is just a sample mini web application that I created to learn [Ember.js][].

 > **NOTE:** May only work in Google Chrome

You can use [Ember TODO][todo] at **[http://remi.github.com/ember-todo][todo]**

Implemented So Far
------------------

 - `@ember` Use an Ember model (`Todo`)
 - `@ember` Use an Ember controller (`Todos.todosController as singleton`)
 - `@ember` Use Ember views
 - `@ember` Use `{{action}}` to trigger functions on views on event
 - `@ember` Use `.observes("collection.@each.property")`
 - `@ember` Use `classBinding="someBoolProperty"` to get `class="some-bool-property"` (when truthy)
 - `@ember` Use a `{{view}}` instance per model instance (inside an `{{each}}` loop)
 - `@ember` Use Ember.TextField
 - `@ember` Catch event on View without using `{{action}}` (by overriding function with event name on view)
 - `@story` As a User I should be able to add a Todo
 - `@story` As a User I should be able to remove a Todo
 - `@story` As a User I should be able to prioritize Todos by dragging/dropping (*implemented with HTML5*)
 - `@story` As a User my Todos should be persisted across sessions (*implemented with localStorage*)
 - `@story` As a User I should be able to edit a Todo (in-place)

Backlog (TODO)
